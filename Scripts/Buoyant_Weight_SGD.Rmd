### Description
This R Markdown file is meant to create a graph that evaluates the change in buoyant weight of corals from Callie's 2023 Moorea experiment against the SGD Gradient.

Data for this project is accessed from GitHub [here](https://github.com/donahuem/MooreaCoralFish_CS/tree/main/Coral_Data)
```{r}
#add libraries
library(gdata)
library(reshape)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# adding data
Buoyant_weight_Pac <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donahuem/MooreaCoralFish_CS/main/Coral_Data/PAC_Buoyant_Weight.csv")
No_NA_Buoyant_weight_Pac <- Buoyant_weight_Pac%>%
               drop_na(T1_Weight)

BioGC.Info_raw <-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njsilbiger/MooreaSGD_site-selection/main/Data/August2021/Allbiogeochemdata_QC.csv")
BioGC.Info <- BioGC.Info_raw %>%
  filter(!Date == "2021-08-06") #filter out Varari high wave event
BioGC.Info <- BioGC.Info %>%
  filter(!Location == "Cabral") #filter out Cabral data
```
Now that the data is loaded, I have started making preliminary graphs
```{r}

```
