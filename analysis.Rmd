### Introduction

This is a R Markdown file in which I hope to write out my analyses. I will use this document to process all the R scripts found in the R folder and complete my project. 

#### Tidying the data
```{r tidy_data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#reminder you can make one of these with CMD+opt+i
library(here)
source(here("R","FCM_Tidy.R"))
source(here("R","TLE_Tidy.R"))
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
```

```{r}
FCM <- read.csv("output/FCM_data.csv")
ggplot(FCM)+
  geom_point(aes(x=Cage_Uncaged, y=sym_FSC.Events, color=Species))
```
