### Introduction

This is a R Markdown file in which I hope to write out my analyses. I will use this document to process all the R scripts found in the R folder and complete my project. 

#### Tidying the data
```{r tidy_data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#reminder you can make one of these with CMD+opt+i
library(here)
source(here("R","FCM_Tidy.R"))
source(here("R","TLE_Tidy.R"))
```

```{r}

```
